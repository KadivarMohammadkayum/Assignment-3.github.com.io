    <!-- What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3? -->

    <!--CSS3 is split into many various documents known as Modules. 
        each module adds new capability or extends options outlined in CSS2 over conserving backward compatibility. 
        Work on CSS3 started around the time of publication of the initial CSS2 recommendation. 
        The CSS3 version supports more browsers than CSS2. -->
