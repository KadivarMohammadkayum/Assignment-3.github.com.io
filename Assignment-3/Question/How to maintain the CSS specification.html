    <!-- How to maintain the CSS specifications? -->
    
    <!-- The CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The 
         W3C is an international standards organization that works to develop and promote web standards. The CSS 
         specifications are a set of standards that define how CSS should be used to style HTML documents.

          The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an international organization, is the primary standards body for the 
         World Wide Web. A consortium founded by Tim Berners-Lee in 1994 and led by him, it brings together full-time 
         staff from member organizations to work on developing World Wide Web standards.

         It is possible to write CSS by itself, as well as within an HTML file. Insert the HTML file into it.
